# Project Name
> A bike-sharing system provides bikes for short-term use to individuals, often through computer-controlled docks. Users can rent and return bikes easily. A bike-sharing company called BoomBikes has faced revenue drops due to COVID-19 and plans to bounce back by understanding post-lockdown bike demand. They want to know which factors affect bike demand and how well these variables explain it. They've gathered a dataset on daily bike demands, considering factors like weather and people's habits. They're working with a consulting company to analyze this data and prepare for a successful revival once the pandemic situation improves.

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

## Business Goals
- To model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
